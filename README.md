📸🤓 These are the projects I've done for my Computer Vision course! 🖥️💡

Computer Vision or Image Understanding is like the 🎨'art'🎨 of teaching computers to see and understand images. It's all about developing clever techniques to extract useful information from pictures! 🌄📷

We explored various strategies and theories in this course, ranging from traditional methods to the exciting world of Deep Learning 🧠🔍. We learned how to use neural networks to tackle Computer Vision challenges, alongside more traditional approaches. 🤖💥

It was an amazing journey, where pixels turned into meaningful data and pictures transformed into valuable insights. 🌟✨
