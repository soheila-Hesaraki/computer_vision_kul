📽️ From basic image processing towards object detection 🕵️‍♀️🎥

Goal: Apply image processing techniques, detect an object, and create a one-minute video. Submit the video and code.

🎬 Pre-production:
You are the director, writer, producer, and actor of a one-minute film. Read the assignment, plan the story, props, and effects.

🎥 Production:
Record the video (use your phone/webcam). Ensure the footage includes objects.

🎞️ Post-production:

0s-20s: Use basic image processing techniques (±4s).
20s-40s: Detect a round colored object using object detection (±8s).
40s-60s: Create an exciting finale (±20s).
🔬 Basic image processing: 0 - 20s

Switch between color and grayscale (±4s).
Apply smoothing techniques: Gaussian and bi-lateral filters. Explain the difference (±8s).
Grab object in RGB and HSV color space, improve grabbing with morphological operations (±8s).
🔍 Object detection: 20 - 40s

Use Sobel edge detector to detect horizontal and vertical edges. Visualize the edges (±5s).
Utilize Hough transform to detect circular shapes. Show parameter influence on detection (±10s).
Introduce the object, highlight its position with a flashy rectangle. Use grayscale intensity values to indicate likelihood of the object's presence (±2s+3s).
🎉 Carte blanche: 40 - 60s
Demonstrate advanced techniques:

Accurate object detection and influence on the video scene.
Magic effects, manipulation of objects of interest, sharpening out-of-focus objects.
Robustness of the technique to illumination, rotation, scale changes, and movement.
